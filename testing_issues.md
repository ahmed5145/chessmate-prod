# Testing Issues

## Issue 1: Testing Structure Redundancy

**Title**: Unify redundant testing structure

**Description**:
Our current testing approach contains several redundancies that should be consolidated:

1. Duplicate test files - Same utilities are tested in both standalone and Django test files
2. Multiple test runners - We have three different files (`run_tests.py`, `.bat`, `.sh`) for running tests
3. Inconsistent testing styles - Mix of pytest and Django unittest-based TestCase

**Steps to Resolve**:
- [ ] Choose a single testing approach (recommend pytest with Django plugin)
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate tests into a single location
- [ ] Standardize assertion style (use pytest's assert)
- [ ] Create a single test runner with platform-specific wrappers
- [ ] Document the unified testing approach

## Issue 2: CI/CD Redundancy for Testing

**Title**: Streamline CI/CD testing workflows

**Description**:
Currently, we have duplicate testing in our CI/CD pipeline:

1. Testing in both `test.yml` and `ci.yml` workflows
2. Different commands for running tests
3. Duplicate environment setup code

**Steps to Resolve**:
- [ ] Create a single reusable workflow for testing
- [ ] Standardize test commands across workflows
- [ ] Use GitHub Actions matrix for testing with different Python versions
- [ ] Extract environment setup to a reusable step
- [ ] Update documentation for the new CI/CD structure

## Issue 3: Test Configuration Complexity

**Title**: Simplify test configuration

**Description**:
Our test configuration is unnecessarily complex:

1. Complex `conftest.py` that handles both standalone and Django tests
2. Multiple `pytest.ini` files (one in project root, another in `chess_mate/`)
3. Redundant environment setup code

**Steps to Resolve**:
- [ ] Simplify the root `conftest.py` with cleaner, more maintainable configuration
- [ ] Consolidate to a single `pytest.ini` file
- [ ] Create a standardized environment setup process
- [ ] Remove redundant settings code
- [ ] Document the simplified configuration

## Issue 4: Testing Gaps and Coverage Issues

**Title**: Increase test coverage and address testing gaps

**Description**:
Several areas of our codebase lack adequate test coverage:

1. Missing integration tests for critical paths
2. Incomplete mocking of external dependencies
3. Limited frontend test coverage
4. Inconsistent API endpoint testing

**Steps to Resolve**:
- [ ] Implement integration tests for key user flows
- [ ] Standardize mocking approach for external services
- [ ] Increase frontend component test coverage
- [ ] Add contract tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Add performance tests for critical paths
- [ ] Update CI workflow to report and enforce test coverage thresholds

## Issue 5: Non-Best Testing Practices

**Title**: Adopt testing best practices

**Description**:
Our current testing approach doesn't follow several best practices:

1. Manual Redis mocking instead of using established libraries
2. Inconsistent assertion styles
3. Limited use of pytest's parameterization
4. Potential test isolation issues

**Steps to Resolve**:
- [ ] Replace custom Redis mock with fakeredis or similar library
- [ ] Standardize on pytest's assertion style
- [ ] Increase use of parameterized tests for better test case coverage
- [ ] Ensure proper test isolation using pytest-django
- [ ] Document testing best practices for future development
