## Recent Improvements

- **Method Name Fix**: Fixed method name mismatch in the MetricsCalculator (using calculate_game_metrics instead of calculate_metrics)
- **Error Handling**: Fixed an UnboundLocalError in the analyze_game_task related to exception handling
- **Python Version**: Migrated from Python 3.12 to Python 3.11 for better compatibility with Celery and its dependencies 
- **Celery Worker**: Configured Celery to use solo pool on Windows to address permission issues
- **Batch Analysis**: Implemented batch analysis status endpoint to reduce API calls and improve performance
- **CORS Fixes**: Added CORS fixes for cache-control header in preflight requests
- **Authentication Fixes**: Fixed authentication issues in the batch status endpoint
- **User Feedback**: Improved user feedback during game analysis
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for analysis failures

## Known Issues

- Game analysis still has compatibility issues with some chess engine implementations
- Edge cases in rate limiting implementation (partially fixed, needs more fine-tuning)
- Missing test coverage for new modular views (in progress)
- Mobile responsiveness could be improved for complex analytics screens
- Loading states for some operations need enhancement
- Email delivery reliability with certain providers
- Edge cases in game import from Chess.com (specific tournament formats)
- Running Celery on Windows requires using the solo pool due to permission issues
