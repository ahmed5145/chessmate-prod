  - Enhanced error handling, validation, and comprehensive API documentation
  - Health check and monitoring endpoints
- **Frontend**: React with Redux
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with refresh tokens
- **Task Queue**: Celery with Redis
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe
